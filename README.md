Centipede
=========

Re-creation of the classic 80's Centipede game using Unity3D.

All rules are taken from the Atari 2600 version of the game, all the game universe comes from said version's book.

3D models will be created using Blender.
I don't yet know what music creation program I am going to use.

The final version of the game will be running in the Web player.

This is an exercise in:
- using Unity3D
- coding in C#
- project management trhough GitHub
- 3D Modelling
- Music writting
